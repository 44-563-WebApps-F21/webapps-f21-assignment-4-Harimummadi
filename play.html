_PETER SABOUROFF and MICHAEL._


PETER (_warming his hands at a stove_). Has Vera not come back yet,
Michael?<br>

MICH. No, Father Peter, not yet; 'tis a good three miles to the post
office, and she has to milk the cows besides, and that dun one is a rare
plaguey creature for a wench to handle.<br>

PETER. Why didn't you go with her, you young fool? she'll never love you
unless you are always at her heels; women like to be bothered.<br>

MICH. She says I bother her too much already, Father Peter, and I fear
she'll never love me after all.<br>

PETER. Tut, tut, boy, why shouldn't she? you're young and wouldn't be
ill-favoured either, had God or thy mother given thee another face.
Aren't you one of Prince Maraloffski's gamekeepers; and haven't you got
a good grass farm, and the best cow in the village? What more does a
girl want?<br>

MICH. But Vera, Father Peter--<br>

PETER. Vera, my lad, has got too many ideas; I don't think much of ideas
myself; I've got on well enough in life without 'em; why shouldn't my
children? There's Dmitri! could have stayed here and kept the inn; many
a young lad would have jumped at the offer in these hard times; but he,
scatter-brained featherhead of a boy, must needs go off to Moscow to
study the law! What does he want knowing about the law! let a man do his
duty, say I, and no one will trouble him.<br>

MICH. Ay! but Father Peter, they say a good lawyer can break the law as
often as he likes, and no one can say him nay.<br>

PETER. That is about all they are good for; and there he stays, and has
not written a line to us for four months now--a good son that, eh?<br>

MICH. Come, come, Father Peter, Dmitri's letters must have gone
astray--perhaps the new postman can't read; he looks stupid enough, and
Dmitri, why, he was the best fellow in the village. Do you remember how
he shot the bear at the barn in the great winter?<br>
