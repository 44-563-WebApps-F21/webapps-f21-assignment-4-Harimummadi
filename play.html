    _PETER SABOUROFF and MICHAEL._<br>


    <h6 class="PETER">PETER (_warming his hands at a stove_).</h6> 
    <p class="speech">Has Vera not come back yet,Michael?</p>

    <h6 class="MICH">MICH.</h6> 
    <p class="speech"> No, Father Peter, not yet; 'tis a good three miles to the post office, and she has to milk the cows besides, and that dun one is a rare
    plaguey creature for a wench to handle.</p>

    <h6 class="PETER">PETER.</h6> 
    <p class="speech">Why didn't you go with her, you young fool? she'll never love you unless you are always at her heels; women like to be bothered.</p>

    <h6 class="MICH">MICH.</h6> 
    <p class="speech">She says I bother her too much already, Father Peter, and I fear she'll never love me after all.</p>

    <h6 class="PETER">PETER.</h6> 
    <p class="speech">Tut, tut, boy, why shouldn't she? you're young and wouldn't be ill-favoured either, had God or thy mother given thee another face.
    Aren't you one of Prince Maraloffski's gamekeepers; and haven't you got a good grass farm, and the best cow in the village? What more does girl want?</p>

    <h6 class="MICH">MICH.</h6> 
    <p class="speech">But Vera, Father Peter--</p>

    <h6 class="PETER">PETER.</h6> 
    <p class="speech">Vera, my lad, has got too many ideas; I don't think much of ideas myself; I've got on well enough in life without 'em; why shouldn't my children? 
    There's Dmitri! could have stayed here and kept the inn; many a young lad would have jumped at the offer in these hard times; but he, scatter-brained featherhead 
    of a boy, must needs go off to Moscow to study the law! What does he want knowing about the law! let a man do his duty, say I, and no one will trouble him.</p>

    <h6 class="MICH">MICH.</h6> 
    <p class="speech">Ay! but Father Peter, they say a good lawyer can break the law as often as he likes, and no one can say him nay.</p>

    <h6 class="PETER">PETER.</h6> 
    <p class="speech">That is about all they are good for; and there he stays, and has not written a line to us for four months now--a good son that, eh?</p>

    <h6 class="MICH">MICH.</h6> 
    <p class="speech">Come, come, Father Peter, Dmitri's letters must have gone astray--perhaps the new postman can't read; he looks stupid enough, and Dmitri, why, he 
        was the best fellow in the village. Do you remember how he shot the bear at the barn in the great winter?</p>
